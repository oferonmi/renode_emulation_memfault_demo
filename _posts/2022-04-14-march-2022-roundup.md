<!-- excerpt start -->

Here are the articles, videos, and tools that we've been excited about this
March, and we have a few announcements, the first being about [Interrupt's first Quarterly Panel](https://go.memfault.com/embedded-device-observability-metrics-panel) co-hosted with Phillip from Embedded Artistry, and a blurb about this year's [Embedded Online Conference](https://www.embeddedonlineconference.com/)

<!-- excerpt end -->

We hope you enjoy these links, and we look forward to hearing what you've been
reading in the comments or [on the Interrupt Slack](https://interrupt-slack.herokuapp.com/).

## Announcements

1. Interrupt and Phillip from [Embedded Artistry](https://embeddedartistry.com) will be co-hosting quarterly panels with people we enjoy talking to from the embedded space. Our first one is on April 21st at 8:30a PST. 

    We'll be talking to one of my ex-coworkers from Fitbit, Shiva Rajagopal, about essential device metrics to monitor while building & shipping millions of smartwatches! It'll be a blast. 

    [Click here to sign up](https://go.memfault.com/embedded-device-observability-metrics-panel)

2. I'll be presenting at the [Embedded Online Conference](https://www.embeddedonlineconference.com/) again this year. This time it's about [Essential Device Metrics](https://www.embeddedonlineconference.com/session/Essential_Device_and_Firmware_Metrics). I'm also excited for Dan Saks' talk on [C++ for Embedded](https://www.embeddedonlineconference.com/workshop/What_Cplusplus_Can_Do_For_Embedded_Systems) and [Alvaro's talk on Debugging](https://www.embeddedonlineconference.com/session/Adventures_in_Debugging).

    If you register for the Embedded Online Conference and use the code **MEMFAULT**, you'll receive $100 off the registration fee!
