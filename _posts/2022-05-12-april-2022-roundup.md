## Articles & Learning

- [**Memfault & Embedded Artistry Virtual Panel: Building Embedded Systems at Scale with Device Metrics**](https://go.memfault.com/embedded-device-observability-metrics-panel) with Tyler Hoffman, Phillip Johnston, and Shiva Rajagopal<br>
I had a blast chatting with Shiva and Phillip about capturing and collecting device metrics in production to track down hard-to-reproduce bugs and understanding how firmware can degrade over time if the metrics aren't monitored.

- [**Memfault Webinar: Launching an IoT Device: A Blueprint for Success**](https://go.memfault.com/blueprint-for-launching-an-iot-device-webinar) with François Baldassari<br>
François will talk about how to launch a connected device quickly and without fear using some approaches he's learned along the way, such as Day-0 firmware updates, device monitoring, and staged rollouts of firmware updates.

- [**How to Write a Spelling Corrector (Python)**](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) by Peter Norvig<br>
Description of a simple and elegant spell correction algorithm, implemented in 27 lines of Python. - Noah

- [**How to take away its firmware from the QN902x microcontroller - Sudo Null IT News**](https://habr-com.translate.goog/ru/post/663312/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en) by [aleaksah](https://gist.github.com/aleaksah)<br>
Interesting reverse engineering writeup of a Xiaomi smart kettle (original in Russian, translated).

- [**koniarik/teaching-embedded-remotely**](https://github.com/koniarik/teaching-embedded-remotely) by [koniarik](https://github.com/koniarik)<br>
A thoroughly documented setup for running a remote embedded engineering course with shared hardware stations. I especially appreciated the use of Ansible! - Noah

- [**Exploring Xiaomi’s new firmware security measures – RoboCoffee**](https://robocoffee.de/?p=193)<br>
Analyzing a signed firmware update for Xiaomi electric scooters - Noah

- [**Buttons on BL602/Nuttx - Robert Lipe on Technology**](https://www.robertlipe.com/buttons-on-bl602-nuttx/) by Robert Lipe<br>
An article detailing an attack attempt on a Buffalo BL606 NuttX-based chipset. - Tyler

- [**Patching an Embedded OS from 1996 with Ghidra**](http://blog.petersobot.com/patching-the-k2500) by Peter Sobot<br> 
A tale of reverse engineering firmware with Ghidra to patch new behavior into it.

- [**Learning Resources · crossbeam-rs/rfcs Wiki**](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/rfcs/wiki#learning-resources)<br>
A very nice collection of information on concurrency topics - Noah

- [**Initializing Variables in Embedded C++ - Stratify Labs**](https://blog.stratifylabs.dev/device/2022-04-05-Initializing-Variables-in-Embedded-Cpp/)<br>
This article covers pretty much all the possible ways to initialize variables in C++. Who knew there were so many?

- [**4 integers are enough to write a Snake Game**](https://www.andreinc.net/2022/05/01/4-integers-are-enough-to-write-a-snake-game) by Andrei Ciobanu<br>
A fun article showing how to write a game of Snake in C using only a minimal amount of state.

- [**Bisecting a Linux Kernel boot failure due to changed compiler flags**](https://nathanchance.dev/posts/bisect-compiler-flag-problem-linux-kernel/) by Nathan Chancellor<br>
A fantastic use of Git Bisect to help find a bug committed into the Linux Kernel

## Tools & Libraries

- [**Frida - A world-class dynamic instrumentation framework**](https://frida.re/docs/home/)<br>
This is insanely cool- hook some python/js scripting into a running process for debugging, reverse engineering, black box testing, etc. - Noah. From their website, they compare it to GreaseMonkey for native applications. Amazing!

- [**Coding Up an IoT PCB Design**](https://www.geocene.com/tech/hardware/2022/05/03/coding-up-an-iot-pcb-design) by Dylan Jackson<br>
Using code to help generate the PCD designs of hardware using [JITX](https://www.jitx.com/) and exporting to an Altium project.

- [**JITX - Software defined electronics**](https://www.jitx.com/)<br>
As mentioned above in an article, JITX seems like a great way to codify the error-prone PCB design phase.

- [**Compiler Explorer API Documentation**](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/blob/main/docs/API.md)<br>
[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) is one of my favorite tools for testing+sharing small snippets. TIL it supports a LOT of languages, including Python (if you're ever interested in looking at Python bytecode!), as well as provides a compilation-as-a-service (CAAS?) API. One thing it really excels at is testing snippets against a variety of compiler versions (e.g. Clang v10 vs GCC v9, etc), for example, if you've found some anomalous behavior on a particular compiler version and want to quickly check if it's changed in a later version. - Noah

- [**picolibc/picolibc: picolibc - a C library designed for embedded 32- and 64- bit systems**](https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc/)<br>
We've posted about picolibc many times, but I just realized that this is going to be [integrated into Zephyr soon](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/44143)!

- [**espressif/esp-usb-bridge: USB to UART & JTAG bridge, implemented on ESP32-S2 or ESP32-S3**](https://github.com/espressif/esp-usb-bridge)<br>
Turn an ESP32 into a USB->UART/JTAG bridge - Noah

- [**Unit Testing with QP/C++ (qpcpp) and CppUTest**](https://covemountainsoftware.com/2022/04/25/unit-testing-with-the-qpcpp-framework-and-cpputest/) by Matthew Eshleman<br>
Matthew recently released a package which helps get CppUTest & QP/C++ projects up and running with host-based unit testing.
